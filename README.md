## Description
This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am constantly tweaking it.
Some of the plugins are inspired by other people's configurations, some are my own.
I really love using neovim and and the vim-motions. I am trying to create the perfect configuration for me.
And I love that neovim gives me the ability to do that. Creating and tweaking my own PDE.
I hope you find this configuration useful.
My configuration is based around the colorscheme `gruvbox`. 
I am running neovim on Windows so my configuration is based on that but it should work on other platforms as well except for toggleterm which uses powershell.
